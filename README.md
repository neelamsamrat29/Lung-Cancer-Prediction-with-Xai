# LUNG-CANCER-PREDICTION-WITH-XAI-MODELS

Introduction:

Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally, and late-stage diagnoses significantly contribute to its high mortality rate. Early detection of lung cancer is crucial as it enhances the chances of successful treatment. However, traditional diagnostic methods often fail to detect the disease in its early stages, highlighting the need for advanced tools for earlier and more accurate diagnosis. This project aims to develop an innovative lung cancer prediction system by combining both structured clinical data (such as patient demographics, clinical symptoms, and lifestyle factors) and unstructured image data (like chest X-rays) to improve early detection accuracy.

Key Features:

The lung cancer prediction system integrates structured clinical data and chest X-ray images to predict lung cancer risk. The system utilizes a Random Forest Classifier to analyze 16 features from structured data, including age, gender, smoking habits, and symptoms such as shortness of breath and chest pain. A deep learning model, VGG16, is applied to analyze chest X-ray images and detect subtle signs of lung cancer that may be overlooked in traditional clinical data. Additionally, Explainable AI (XAI) techniques like Saliency Maps and Guided Backpropagation are incorporated to provide transparency, helping healthcare professionals understand how predictions are made.

Methodology:

Data Collection and Preprocessing
The structured data, which includes clinical features like patient demographics and symptoms, is extracted from medical records. Simultaneously, chest X-ray images are processed and prepared for input into the deep learning model.

Model Development
The system uses the Random Forest Classifier for processing the structured data, which enables the model to handle complex datasets and identify important predictors of lung cancer. For image data, VGG16, a deep learning model, is used to detect patterns in chest X-ray images related to lung cancer.

Explainable AI:

To make the model's decisions more transparent, Saliency Maps highlight areas in chest X-ray images that are critical for distinguishing between cancerous and non-cancerous tissues. Meanwhile, Guided Backpropagation reveals which features in both the images and structured data are most influential in making predictions.

Prediction and Evaluation:

Once trained, the system combines the predictions from both models (structured data and image analysis) to offer a final risk prediction for lung cancer, which is evaluated for accuracy and effectiveness.

Benefits:

This lung cancer prediction system offers several benefits, including early detection through the combined analysis of structured and image data, leading to improved diagnosis at treatable stages. The system also delivers increased accuracy by integrating multiple data sources and employing advanced machine learning techniques. With the incorporation of Explainable AI, healthcare professionals can trust and interpret the modelâ€™s predictions, fostering adoption in clinical settings. Ultimately, this system aims to improve patient outcomes by providing actionable insights that assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.
